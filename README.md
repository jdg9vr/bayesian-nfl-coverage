Predicting NFL Coverages with Bayesian Methods

## Outline
We created a Bayesian Machine Learning model that classifies plays into 7 coverages (Cover 0-6) based on the pre-snap location of the defense. Our model aggregates 7 one-against-the-rest Bayesian Logstic Regressions with uninformed priors. We wrote a four page report containing details on our methodology and results, which can be accessed here.

## Code
We used Python and specifically the package pymc for this project. The code was written in a jupyter notebook, with very detailed comments and notes. Our code can be found here. 


*Disclaimer: We used the 2023 Big Data Bowl Data in our creation of this model. This data is not to be used for any other purposes beyond the outlines of this paper. For further details on the data, access the 2023 Big Data Bowl page on Kaggle.*
